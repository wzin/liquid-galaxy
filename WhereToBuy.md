For most of the life of the Liquid Galaxy project, we've outsourced Liquid Galaxy construction and support to the fine folks at End Point, who specialize in Free Software support and consulting.

They can help you build your own system, ship out the frame components described on the MechanicalDesign page, or even build a complete Liquid Galaxy and install it on site.

See End Point's [Liquid Galaxy services](http://www.endpoint.com/services/liquid_galaxy) page for more details.<br />
