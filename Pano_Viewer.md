# Introduction #

This repository includes a panoramic image viewer, [here](http://code.google.com/p/liquid-galaxy/source/browse/#git%2Flg-pano), created by End Point Corporation.

# Details #

The panoramic image viewer is a modification of [xiv](http://sourceforge.net/projects/xiv/), extended to allow control via a SpaceNavigator device and synchronization over UDP. Current command line options are available by running the program with the -? option. Installation instructions are [here](http://code.google.com/p/liquid-galaxy/source/browse/lg-pano/INSTALL); essentially, ./configure and make will do the trick. Information on running it is available in the project's README file [here](http://code.google.com/p/liquid-galaxy/source/browse/lg-pano/README).
