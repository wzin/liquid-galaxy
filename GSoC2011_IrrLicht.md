# Introduction #

Irrlicht is an open source 3D graphics engine written in C++ which is know for its ease of use. The goal of this project is to integrate NVS into the project to make it compatible with the liquid galaxy project. This would allow the use of any games currently built with the engine to seamlessly integrate with the liquid galaxy experience.

# Code #
The repository containing the publicly released code can be downloaded with git as follows
`git clone https://github.com/bwright/gsoc`

The bleeding edge features are stored on a private sever which requires a PGP key to access however I will be phasing this out over the next week or so. (code@uberwolf.com:gsoc.git)

# Blog #
I have a blog where I post about updates to my project. These are generally in the form of weekly posts since I have final exams on this week and next however updates every day can be expected afterwards: http://www.uberwolf.com/topics/labs/liquid-galaxy/
