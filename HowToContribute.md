If you build a Liquid Galaxy installation of your own, send us a note on the [liquid-galaxy email list](http://groups.google.com/group/liquid-galaxy) so we can add you to the [Gallery](LiquidGalaxyGallery.md).

If you have an improvement to suggest, we'd love to hear about that, too. The easiest way to contribute code is to find (or submit) an issue in the [Issues Tracker](http://code.google.com/p/liquid-galaxy/issues/list), write code that addresses the issue, then upload a subversion diff that patches the issue.

Before we can use your patch, we'll need a CLA:

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html).
  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work to Google Data Python Client Library, then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html)
